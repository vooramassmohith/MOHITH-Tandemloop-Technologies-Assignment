 =>MOHITH VOORANDOORI - Tandemloop Assignment

Language Used: Python 3

 =>Files
- Problem-1.py  -> Calculator class (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Problem-2.py  -> Generate first `a` odd numbers (exactly a terms)
- Problem-3.py  -> Pattern: if `a` odd -> `a` odd numbers, if `a` even -> `a-1` odd numbers
- Problem-4.py  -> Count how many elements are multiples of each number in 1..9

=>How to run
For each problem, run:

=>Otherwise follow and run this.
(Or open files and run in your IDE. The scripts include sample runs under `if __name__ == "__main__":`.)

Notes
- All files are independent and placed in the root of repository as requested.
- I provided friendly error messages for invalid operations (Problem-1).
- If the expected pattern for Problem-3 is slightly different, please share the exact examples and I will update the implementation quickly.
